How to set up the external files used in this program
------------------------------------------------------

1) Copy these 3 files from the src/networkfiles to a location of your choice:  WIOA_Application12PDF.pdf, twntyqstns_be.accdb, twntyqstns.accdb

2) In the LocalCustomization file, set up the new pathways to these files on your system. Remember to also set where you want to save reports. 

3) Now use Microsoft Access to relink the database files:
  a. Open  twntyqstns.accdb  in Microsoft Access 
  b. Under the “External Data” tab in MS Access, we will use “Linked Table Manager” to relink the file to its partner back end file, twntyqstns_be.
  c. Choose “Add” to add a new link. Skip the name and choose Access as the “Select Source Data” and click “Next” 
  d. Choose the file  twntyqstns_be  in its new location. Leave the password field empty and choose “Finish” (The _be is the "backend" file, you can Google "Split an Access database" to learn more)
  e. Follow the prompts to relink tables by choosing “Select All” or “ok” for each table.  
  f. Once back to the original linking screen, click a box to check and “Delete” any older links. Close the Linked Table Manager.
