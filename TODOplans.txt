1. Customize the look with css. Note--css classes are already included in the project, just not utilized  //  a website that might be helpful is https://www.vojtechruzicka.com/javafx-css/

2. Currently, there is no "error exception" visible to the user if the staff login page does not connect to the database. An error shows if the username and password is incorrect, but nothing happens if the database just isn't accessible. Need to add this custom message or write a general error message for user to see. 

3. There needs to be a check added to the dropdown where a user chooses a date to not allow a user to choose a month and "31" if the month does not have 31 days.

TODO   // Plans for future or different versions
---------------------------------------------------
1. Create the option for staff users to implement their own pdf by using PDFescape to create fillable form fields on an existing PDF and then allowing the program to upload those fields and prompt the user to enter information...this will take some planning.

2. Create a version of the program that uses 3 custom pages, allowing staff with no programming knowledge to set up own printable reports from user input.

3. Create a web-based version of the program so instead of using a local database file stored on a secured area of the network, it accesses an online secured database. Would an MS Access file stored in a Google account work?
